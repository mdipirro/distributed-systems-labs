# Distributed Systems

This repository contains the execises assigned during the lab session of the course [Distributed Systems](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be//2017/syllabi/e/H0N08AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp5852320) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) (1st semester).

Exercises are about the design and development of a car rental application. Three are the technologies used for this project:
1. Java RMI, with manual synchronization and no support for peristency and distributed transactions;
2. Java EE, using both JPA (for persistency purposes) and JTA (for distributed transactions);
3. Google App Engine, to explore and clarify the differences with JEE. JPA is still used for the sake of persistency, but with some modifications (due to limitations imposed by GAE). The same applies to transactions.

Every topic is further refined into sessions corresponding to the given assignments. Java RMI and GAE come with small reports explaining the design and analyzing differences and trade-offs.
