\section{Design overview}
The main components of the \texttt{CarRental}'s distributed design are located in the \texttt{session} package. It comprises the three remotely accessible interfaces: \texttt{SessionManagerI}, \texttt{RentalSessionI}, and \texttt{ManagerSessionI}. The first manages the association between renters and their rental session. A client may create a new rental session only via this manager. Lastly, \texttt{ManagerSessionI}, provides a stateless session for managing purposes. 

The \texttt{rental} package implements the application's business logic. There is only one addition to the provided code: \texttt{RentalStore}. This class implements the naming service and provides company registration, unregistration and lookup.
